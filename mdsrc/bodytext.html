<h1>Guide to the reduced simulation files</h1>

<p><code>updated 5 May 2014</code></p>

<p>This directory contains reduced FITS files from three simulations of a 10pc box. In each simulation the box contains ~5700 Solar masses of gas, at an isothermal 10K. The initial conditions are generated by driving turbulence at large scales and allowing small scale turbulence to develop self-consistently from there; the approximately steady state Mach number is 8. Further details can be found in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1402.2614M">this paper</a>. </p>

<h2>The simulation directories</h2>

<h3>Periodic</h3>

<p>The 10pc box is periodic in all directions. (This is very similar the simulation described in that paper).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>mean number density 100 cm^-3, total mass 5700 Msun  </p></li>
<li><p>Mach 8 turbulence </p></li>
<li><p>isothermal equation of state </p></li>
<li><p>base computational grid 256^3 </p></li>
<li><p>max effective resolution 16384^3</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Isolated</h3>

<p>The 10 pc cube is isolated, with outflow boundaries, but weakly inflowing boundary conditions. The grid setup and initial conditions are identical to the Periodic run. This sounds a little weird, but all it means is that gas that leaves the cube edge due to its initial velocity is lost from the simulation, but there is a steady low velocity, low density, high temperature inflow containing the initial gas. the inflow parameters are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>density: 0.1 cm^-3 with mu = 1.281 </p></li>
<li><p>velocity: 2 km/s </p></li>
<li><p>P / k: 700K   (k is Boltzmann's constant) </p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Wind</h3>

<h4>!! not ready yet !!</h4>

<p>Similar to the isolated case. Five of the six cube boundaries have identical low density, low velocity, high temperature inflows like the Isolated case. One boundary is a high velocity, high pressure wind source with parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>density: 0.1 cm^-3 with mu = 1.281 </p></li>
<li><p>velocity: 15 km/s </p></li>
<li><p>P / k: 7000K   (k is Boltzmann's constant) </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The files in each directory</h2>

<p>In each directory are a series of FITS files. For snapshot, and for each cube axis, I provide a column density map at a resolution of 1024^2 (so each pixel is 10 pc / 1024 = 0.009765625 pc). I provide three column density maps: the total column, an approximation of C18O integrated intensity, and an approximation of N2H+ integrated intensity.</p>

<p>Each file is named like <code>[descriptive.name].[a 4 digit number].[1 digit number].fits</code>. The 4 digit number is the time of the snapshot in kyr, i.e. 1000 = 1 Myr. 
The 1 digit number is the projection axis; 0 = X, 1 = Y, 2 = Z. So 0 is the Y-Z plane, 1 is the X-Z plane, and 2 is the X-Y plane. </p>

<h4>columndensity.total.XXXX.Y.fits</h4>

<p>These are maps of the total column density. <br />
<code>Units: g cm^-2</code>.</p>

<h4>columndensity.C18O.XXXX.Y.fits</h4>

<p>The C18O maps are generated by calculating the column density of gas with H2 number densities between 10^3 and 10^4.5 cm^-3. This density is calculated from the mass density using a mean molecular weight mu=2.33. The conversion from column density to integrated intensity can be achieved using equation 2 of <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...551..687M">Meier &amp; Turner ApJ 551, 687, 2001</a>. <br />
<code>Units: g cm^-2</code>.</p>

<h4>columndensity.N2H+.XXXX.Y.fits</h4>

<p>The N2H+ maps are generated by calculating the column density of gas with H2 number densities above 10^4.5 cm^-3, again with mu=2.33. <br />
<code>Units: g cm^-2</code>.</p>

<h4>spectra.C18O.XXXX.fits</h4>

<h4>!! not ready yet !!</h4>

<p>These are PPV data cubes in the X-Y plane (corresponding to the ...2.fits column density files). The spectra are generated by calculating the C18O-density-weighted line-of-sight velocity through each pixel. Each value is converted to a Gaussian line with thermal width (the Gaussian dispersion) 0.0526 km s^-1. The spectra are normalized by getting the integrated intensity for each pixel, in K km s^-1, using Meier &amp; Turner paper. The spectra are binned with bin width 0.05 km s^-1. The spectral bin centers, <code>in km s^-1</code>, are in the file <code>spectra.C18O.bincenters.csv</code>. <br />
<code>Units: K</code></p>

<h4>spectra.N2H+.XXXX.fits</h4>

<h4>!! not ready yet !!</h4>

<p>These are PPV data cubes in the X-Y plane (corresponding to the ...2.fits column density files). The spectra are generated by calculating the N2H+-density-weighted line-of-sight velocity through each pixel. Each value is split into 7 hyperfine lines, each on a Gaussian with thermal width (the Gaussian dispersion) 0.0535 km s^-1. The line velocity centers relative to the main line, in km s^-1, are: 6.9360, 5.9842, 5.5452, 0.9560, 0.0, -6.109, -8.0064. Their relative intensities are: 0.03704, 0.18519, 0.11111, 0.18519, 0.25926, 0.11111, 0.11111.</p>

<p>The spectra are normalized by getting the integrated intensity for each pixel, in K km s^-1, using the empirical relationship <br />
N(H2) [cm-2] ~ 7E21 * I(N2H+) [K kms-1] <br />
The spectra are binned with bin width 0.05 km s^-1. The spectral bin centers, <code>in km s^-1</code>, are in the file <code>spectra.N2H+.bincenters.csv</code>. <br />
<code>Units: K</code></p>
