Guide to the reduced simulation files
==================================
`updated 10 June 2014`

This directory contains reduced FITS files from three simulations of a 10pc box. In each simulation the box contains ~5700 Solar masses of gas, at an isothermal 10K. The initial conditions are generated by driving turbulence at large scales and allowing small scale turbulence to develop self-consistently from there; the approximately steady state Mach number is 8. Further details can be found in [this paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1402.2614M). 

The simulation directories
--------------------------
###Periodic
The 10pc box is periodic in all directions. (This is very similar the simulation described in that paper).

* mean number density 100 cm^-3, total mass 5700 Msun  

* Mach 8 turbulence 

* isothermal equation of state 

* base computational grid 256^3 

* max effective resolution 16384^3


###Isolated
The 10 pc cube is isolated, with outflow boundaries, but weakly inflowing boundary conditions. The grid setup and initial conditions are identical to the Periodic run. This sounds a little weird, but all it means is that gas that leaves the cube edge due to its initial velocity is lost from the simulation, but there is a steady low velocity, low density, high temperature inflow containing the initial gas. the inflow parameters are:

* density: 0.1 cm^-3 with mu = 1.281 

* velocity: 2 km/s 

* P / k: 700K   (k is Boltzmann's constant) 

###Wind
####!! not ready yet !!
Similar to the isolated case. Five of the six cube boundaries have identical low density, low velocity, high temperature inflows like the Isolated case. One boundary is a high velocity, high pressure wind source with parameters:

* density: 0.1 cm^-3 with mu = 1.281 

* velocity: 15 km/s 

* P / k: 7000K   (k is Boltzmann's constant) 

The files in each directory
--------------------------
In each directory are a series of FITS files. For snapshot, and for each cube axis, I provide a column density map at a resolution of 1024^2 (so each pixel is 10 pc / 1024 = 0.009765625 pc). I provide three column density maps: the total column, an approximation of C18O integrated intensity, and an approximation of N2H+ integrated intensity.

Each file is named like ```[descriptive.name].[a 4 digit number].[1 digit number].fits```. The 4 digit number is the time of the snapshot in kyr, i.e. 1000 = 1 Myr. 
The 1 digit number is the projection axis; 0 = X, 1 = Y, 2 = Z. So 0 is the Y-Z plane, 1 is the X-Z plane, and 2 is the X-Y plane. 

####columndensity.total.XXXX.Y.fits
These are maps of the total column density.   
```Units: g cm^-2```.

####columndensity.C18O.XXXX.Y.fits
The C18O maps are generated by calculating the column density of gas with H2 number densities between 10^3 and 10^4.5 cm^-3. This density is calculated from the mass density using a mean molecular weight mu=2.33. The conversion from column density to integrated intensity can be achieved using equation 2 of [Meier & Turner ApJ 551, 687, 2001](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...551..687M).  
```Units: g cm^-2```.

####columndensity.N2H+.XXXX.Y.fits
The N2H+ maps are generated by calculating the column density of gas with H2 number densities above 10^4.5 cm^-3, again with mu=2.33.  
```Units: g cm^-2```.

####ppp.XXXX.fits
A 512^3 ppp cube containing the density for one corner of the simulation. 
```Units: g cm^-3```.

####sink.XXXX.csv
A csv file with sink particle information for each snapshot. These sinks are very large and are not individual stars; their radius is about 500 au, and the flow around them will not be terribly well resolved. So any fragmentation, disks, etc. that should be occurring in a real star formation site will not be resolved. You may want to add their mass to the N2H+ projections somehow.
column1: sink ID  
column2: sink mass in Msun  
column3-6: sink position in units of the box length, i.e. from 0-1.  
column7-9: sink velocity in code units. to convert to km/s, multiply by 0.6559.  

Note that some of the sink masses are very small- this is an unfortunate side effect of the large sink radius and the stringent refinement criterion I used in the simulations. These are regions which would probably not have generated a sink in a simulation with resolution down to something like a few au; only regions that are truly collapsing form sinks with any appreciable mass in this simulation. Toward the end of the simulation there are many more of these; this is a signal that combination of the implemented physics and the resolution of the simulation is starting to become inadequate.

####spectra.C18O.XXXX.fits
These are PPV data cubes in the X-Y plane (corresponding to the ...2.fits column density files). The spectra are generated by calculating the C18O-density-weighted line-of-sight velocity through each pixel. Each value is converted to a Gaussian line with thermal width (the Gaussian dispersion) 0.0526 km s^-1. The spectra are normalized by getting the integrated intensity for each pixel, in K km s^-1, using Meier & Turner paper. The spectra are binned with bin width 0.05 km s^-1. The spectral bin centers, ```in km s^-1```, are in the file ```spectra.C18O.bincenters.csv```.  
```Units: K```

####spectra.N2H+.XXXX.fits
These are PPV data cubes in the X-Y plane (corresponding to the ...2.fits column density files). The spectra are generated by calculating the N2H+-density-weighted line-of-sight velocity through each pixel. Each value is split into 7 hyperfine lines, each on a Gaussian with thermal width (the Gaussian dispersion) 0.0535 km s^-1. The line velocity centers relative to the main line, in km s^-1, are: 6.9360, 5.9842, 5.5452, 0.9560, 0.0, -6.109, -8.0064. Their relative intensities are: 0.03704, 0.18519, 0.11111, 0.18519, 0.25926, 0.11111, 0.11111.

The spectra are normalized by getting the integrated intensity for each pixel, in K km s^-1, using the empirical relationship  
N(H2) [cm-2] ~ 7.3E21 * I(N2H+) [K kms-1],
where N(H2) is calculated using only the high density gas with n>10^4.5 cm^-3.
The spectra are binned with bin width 0.05 km s^-1. The spectral bin centers, ```in km s^-1```, are in the file ```spectra.N2H+.bincenters.csv```.  
```Units: K```
